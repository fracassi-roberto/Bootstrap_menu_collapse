# Bootstrap navbar fix for single page web sites

If you use it on a single page website, Bootstrap navbar has an unpleasant (at least from my point of view) behavior.

Once uncollapsed, it will not return collapsed after clicking on an internal link.

I made a small Jquery snippet to correct this behavior

Works for bootstrap 4

To see different behaviors check this [pen](https://codepen.io/fracassi-roberto/pen/vYLGzEW) - Set max-width:992px to collapse navbar.

Just try to use/ do not use the snippet to see different behaiors.
